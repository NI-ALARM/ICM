# ICM
Instrument Communication Module for LabVIEW
ICM is an open-source LabVIEW toolkit, written in LabVIEW 2015, for acquiring and writing to "slow" data. The main structure is that a Bus class defines where data is acquired from and returns a string of data, a Parser class converts the string of data into an array of double precision reals, and an optional Scaling class scales the data values. ICM is extended beyond just instruments that return a string of data by using a No-op Parser child to unflatten a string that contains an array of doubles. This allows the Bus class to include data acquisition models such as NI Daq A/D devices, Modbus devices, and more. An Output class has been planned but not yet implemented, allowing ICM to write to instruments as well as read.
It is intended that the ICM project be installed in the directory  C:\OCC\ICM  If it is installed elsewhere, one can edit the ICM Main Path.vi to accommodate another location.
